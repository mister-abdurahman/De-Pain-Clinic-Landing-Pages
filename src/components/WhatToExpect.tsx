          What to Expect During Neuroacupuncture Treatment
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground text-sm text-center">
          At De Pain & Paralysis Clinic, every Neuroacupuncture session is
          carefully designed to restore your nervous system and relieve pain
          effectively. Here’s how the process works:

              1. Initial Assessment
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              We begin with a detailed consultation to understand your medical
              history, symptoms, and pain pattern. Neurological and
              musculoskeletal evaluations are carried out to identify affected
              nerves, muscles, and functional limitations.

              2. Treatment Planning
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              A personalized treatment plan is created, tailored to your
              specific condition — whether it’s chronic neck pain, lumbar spine
              problems, knee pain, paralysis, or nerve damage. We determine
              which scalp, cranial, and body points will best stimulate your
              nervous system.

              3. Needle Placement
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Very fine, sterile needles are inserted gently and precisely into
              specific points on the scalp and body. On the scalp, we target
              regions corresponding to the motor and sensory cortex to activate
              nerve pathways linked to movement and sensation. On the body,
              points may be selected to improve circulation, reduce
              inflammation, and strengthen muscles.

              4. Neurostimulation
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              In some cases, a mild electrical stimulation is applied through
              the needles. This enhances the signals between the brain and
              nerves, helping to “reawaken” dormant nerve cells and accelerate
              repair.

              5. Guided Movements & Monitoring
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              During the session, gentle movements of the limbs may be
              encouraged to reinforce brain-body communication. Patients often
              notice immediate changes such as reduced pain, increased strength,
              or improved mobility.

              6. Duration & Frequency
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Each session typically lasts 30–45 minutes. Noticeable
              improvements can be seen after the first few treatments, though
              chronic or long-standing conditions may require a structured
              treatment plan over several weeks.

              Why It Works
            </h4>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Neuroacupuncture works by directly influencing the brain and
              nervous system. It stimulates neuroplasticity — the brain’s
              ability to rewire and heal — helping damaged nerves recover and
              reducing chronic pain at its source.
